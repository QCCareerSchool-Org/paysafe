/**
 * The storedCredential object is used to identify authorization requests that use stored credentials for a consumer,
 * in order to improve authorization rates and reduce fraud. Stored credentials can be used in two cases:
 * 
 * Using a payment token – An authorization request that uses a paymentToken from the Customer Vault API
 * Using a card number – An authorization request that uses a credit card number stored by the merchant
 * 
 * Notes:
 * * If you use a paymentToken in the authorization request but do not include the storedCredential object, Paysafe
 *   will provide default information taken from Customer Vault data.
 * * You cannot include both the storedCredential object and the recurring parameter in the same authorization request.
 *   Paysafe recommends using the storedCredential object.
 * * The cvv parameter of the card object is required when the occurrence parameter is set to INITIAL. However, cvv is
 *   not required when the occurrence parameter is set to SUBSEQUENT.
 * * The storedCredential object cannot be used for Apple Pay or Google Pay transactions.
